This provides sources for the [BlazorElectron](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BlazorElectron) package, which in turn supports the [Blazor Electron experimental sample](http://github.com/SteveSandersonMS/BlazorElectronExperiment.Sample).

If you want to try running a Blazor+Electron app, **don't use this repo**. Instead, use the [BlazorElectronExperiment.Sample repo](http://github.com/SteveSandersonMS/BlazorElectronExperiment.Sample).
