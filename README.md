This is a fork of [the main Blazor repo](http://github.com/aspnet/blazor) that exists to support the [Blazor Electron experimental sample](http://github.com/SteveSandersonMS/BlazorElectronExperiment.Sample).

If you want to try running a Blazor+Electron app, **don't use this repo**. Instead, use the [BlazorElectronExperiment.Sample repo](http://github.com/SteveSandersonMS/BlazorElectronExperiment.Sample).

# Extra-experimental and unsupported

This repo is purely a short-term spike to help us understand how such a hosting model would
be implemented and how it would be likely to perform.

The code in this repo is **not maintained**. If you wish to post any issues to let us know
how you've got on with it, please feel free to do so. But please **don't expect any issues to be
fixed, nor any support questions to be answered**.

Likewise, I won't be updating any code here to match newer versions of Blazor. It's a one-time spike only.
